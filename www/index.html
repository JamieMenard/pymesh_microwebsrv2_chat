            DIRECTIONS:<br />
            <br />
            Click on the LHVW Chat link below, wait 30 seconds or so for the "Welcome" Message to load and send messsages!<br />
            <br />
            This is more like HAM radio than Gchat, so don't expect that all the messages get to where you expect. If you don't get an answer<br />
            Wait a bit and try to resend!<br />
            And even if the "house" you want to talk to is listed as being online, that doesn't mean <br />
            there's a computer connected to it! The message will be saved to the node and they can access it later.<br />
            <br />
            If you want to see a full list of messages to your node since it's been powered on, click the "Chat Log" link towards the bottom of<br />
            of the page. If should have any messages saved that you missed while not having a computer connected. <br />
            Be sure to refresh the chat log page to see the lastest messages.
